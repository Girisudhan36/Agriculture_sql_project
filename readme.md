üîç SQL Analysis Performed

All queries are available in analysis_queries.sql. Below are the insights derived using advanced SQL queries:

####1Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Crops by Average Yield

SELECT crop, ROUND(AVG(yield_ton_per_hec), 2) AS avg_yield
FROM crop_data
GROUP BY crop
ORDER BY avg_yield DESC
LIMIT 5;

####2Ô∏è‚É£ Second Most Productive Crop in Each State

WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT crop, state_name, SUM(production_in_tons) AS total_production,
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY state_name ORDER BY SUM(production_in_tons) DESC) AS rank
  FROM crop_data
  GROUP BY crop, state_name
)
SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE rank = 2;

####3Ô∏è‚É£ State with Highest Total Cotton Production

SELECT state_name, SUM(production_in_tons) AS total_cotton_production
FROM crop_data
WHERE LOWER(crop) = 'cotton'
GROUP BY state_name
ORDER BY total_cotton_production DESC
LIMIT 1;

####4Ô∏è‚É£ Avg. Rainfall & Temp by Crop Type (pH 6-7.5)

SELECT crop_type, ROUND(AVG(rainfall), 2) AS avg_rainfall,
       ROUND(AVG(temperature), 2) AS avg_temperature
FROM crop_data
WHERE ph BETWEEN 6 AND 7.5
GROUP BY crop_type;

####5Ô∏è‚É£ Crop Rank in Each State by Production

SELECT state_name, crop, SUM(production_in_tons) AS total_production,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY state_name ORDER BY SUM(production_in_tons) DESC) AS rank
FROM crop_data
GROUP BY state_name, crop;

####6Ô∏è‚É£ Crops Grown in More Than One Crop Type

SELECT crop, COUNT(DISTINCT crop_type) AS crop_type_count
FROM crop_data
GROUP BY crop
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT crop_type) > 1;

####7Ô∏è‚É£ Top 3 Crops by Average Yield per State

WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT state_name, crop, ROUND(AVG(yield_ton_per_hec), 4) AS average_yield,
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY state_name ORDER BY AVG(yield_ton_per_hec) DESC) AS rank
  FROM crop_data
  GROUP BY state_name, crop
)
SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE rank <= 3;

####8Ô∏è‚É£ Low-Yield Crops Grown in at Least 3 States

SELECT crop, ROUND(AVG(yield_ton_per_hec), 4) AS avg_yield,
       COUNT(DISTINCT state_name) AS number_of_states
FROM crop_data
GROUP BY crop
HAVING AVG(yield_ton_per_hec) < 1 AND COUNT(DISTINCT state_name) >= 3;
